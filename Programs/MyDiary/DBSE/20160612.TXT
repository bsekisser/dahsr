What a Fucked up day. . . 

Kay wanted a new dishwasher,
(yep, after 10 years, the old one's starting to crap out)
so Dougie and I went to Lowes to get a new one.

Bad idea, bad, really bad. .  

Why, in God's name would a father say to his son "Fuck You"!

That is SICK, so SICK!!

I am sorry, s-o-o-o-o sorry.

My father NEVER said things like this to me.

All his life I've been proud of him.

I've always said nice things about "Number One", even when he pissed me off.

But, what's said, is said.

I may regret it the reat of my life!
