My Diary:
0945:
I just realized; of all of our families, both the wife's and mine, we're the only couple without grandchildren!

We have two boys. . . er, ah, let me rephrase that, at 39 and 45, they're men, that arent married; they don't have "Girlfriends". Are the homo? Hell, they don't even have "Boyfriends"!

There are families with men that are bachelors but every family has someone that is married, with children!

Loners?

I feel so damned "Out of Place"!
