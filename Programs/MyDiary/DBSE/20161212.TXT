My Diary:
Today, it's been six months since Douglas has talked to me; obviously, it's no longer anger, but an issue, an agenda, or worse, a vendetta. Can we really blame him?.

I have to be fair an consider that may he is just afraid to say anything to me for fear that I would jump on him; which is reasonable, I guess.

Can we make up? For the sake of his mother, I would certainly hope.
