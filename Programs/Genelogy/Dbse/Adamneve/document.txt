[FAMILY]Adam &amp; Eve
[DOC]Preface

<p>
It is a common belief that all of the families of earth came from one Adam and Eve and
that they are mentioned in Genesis, chapters 1 and 2.
</p>
<p>
In chapter 1, on the sisth day, all the races of the earth, red, yellow, black, and white
were created. Then God rested on the seventh day.
</p>
<p>
In chapter 2, God created Adam and he was a farmer, a &quot;Husbandman&quot;.
Howver, this &quot;Adam&quot; &amp; &quot;Eve&quot; are <em>The</em> &quot;Adam&quot;
&amp; &quot;Eve&quot;, of which are the progenitors of the Hebrews of which, through
David, the King of Israel, came our Lord and Saviour,
<span class="rtxt">Jesus Christ</span>!
</p>
<p>
After the captivity of the ten northern tribes of Israel from the Syria, they did not
return to Judah. They supposedly &quot;Dissappeared&quit;. Where did they go?
It is believed by some scholars that, when they left summaria, instead of returning to
Israel, they migrated across the Caucassus mountains of Asia, to populate Europe and then
later migrate to England and America. Now, that doesn't sound so far-fetched when one
considers that, at one time, all &quot;Whites&quot; were considered &quot;Caucasions&quot;
and their origin was only known to be from the area of the Caucassian mountains.

Gen 12:1  "Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country,
and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will show thee:"
<br>
Gen 12:2  "And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee,
and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:"
<br>
Gen 12:3  "And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee:
and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed."

Israel's whereabouts can probably be found if one would but look around and
observe the nation that has been blessed of God.
