</a>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Halls, when first settling in the province of Maryland, were Roman Catholics but
some of the later generation became members of the Church of England and removed from St. Mary's
County. Of these latter we find Captain John Hall who was born in 1658 and who, in 1694,
purchased certain tracts of land from Michael Judd on 8 August; Edward Boothby, 26 May; and
others sufficient to make up 1539 acres which he, that year, had surveyed, on the Bush River
in the northern part of Baltimore County. He had on the 18 July 1693 of the year previous
married Martha Gouldsmith nee Beadle. They had seven children. The records of St.George's Parish
state that Madam Martha Hall died 4 February 1720, aged 52 years; John died in August 1737.
By his will, bearing date of 4 January 1737, he bequeaths to his oldest surviving son, Edward, a
part of a tract of land on which he then lived, called Cranberry Hall, lying on the east of the
Mill Branch and also 600 acres on Deer Creek. To his son, John, he leaves his lands lying on
Spesutia and Mosquito Creeks, Taylors Good Hope 400 acres and Timber Nest 470 acres. To his son,
Parker, that part of Cranberry Hall lying west of Mill Run and Jerico 1000 acres. To his
daughter, Sophia, a tract of land called &quot;Sophia's Dowery&quot; parts of Hall's Plains and
Simon's Neglect. To his grandson, John, son of Aquilla, he gives the new quarter containing 600
acres.
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophia Hall married Thomas White prior to 1731; he was born in London in 1704, the son of
William White and Elizabeth Leigh. His father at one time possessed a considerable patrimony;
but having, it would seem, parted with a large portion of it and died in 1708 at an early age
leaving a widow and five children. In 1720, Thomas sailed for Maryland and there is reason to
think that he was of the retinue of Charles Calvert, the cousin of Lord Baltimore, who certainly
reached the New World in that year with a large company of gentlemen to succeed Mr. Hart as
governor of the province. We are told on the authority of Bishop White that his father, when he
sailed, had been apprenticed to Mr. Stokes, the clerk of the County of Baltimore. The fee of 100
Guineas was given this gentlemen that he might bring the boy up to the profession of law, having
become a Deputy of Mr. Stokes and purchased books, he practiced law and soon laid up the money
with which he bought his lands. Sophia and Thomas had 3 children; Sophia Hall, born 8 May 1731;
Elizabeth born 28 January 1733; and Sarah Charlotte born 25 October 1736.
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colonel White's wife, Sophia, died 18 June 1742, and about 1745 he moved to Philadelphia
and on 7 May 1747, at Christ Church, he married Esther, the widow of the late John Newman and
daughter of Abraham Hawlings of Burlington, New Jersey, a lady of much force of character,
coming of a family that among Quakers had constantly adherred to the Church of England. By this
marriage, Colonel White had 2 children;<br>
William, Bishop of Philadelphia, born 24 March 1747, died 16 July 1836; Mary who was born in
Philadelphia 13 April 1749, married Robert Morris Jr., 2 March 1769, the future finacier of the
American Revolution. He was born in Liverpool, England, 31 January 1734. His father was Robert
Morris who came to America and settled on the eastern shore of Maryland and died there 12 July
1750. Robert Jr. then went to Philadelphia and entered the counting house of Mr. Charles Willing,
the first merchant of his day, and in 1754 at the age of 20, formed a co-partnership with his
son, Thomas Willing, which lasted 39 years; and the firm of Willing and Morris became the best
known and largest importing house in the Colonies.<br>
Robert Morris died 7 May 1806 and was placed in a vault at Christ Church, second street,
Philadelphia, Tuesday, 16 January 1827. Colonel White died at Sophia's Dowery, 29 September 1779,
attended by his wife and son. Mr. White died Friday evening, 31 December 1790.
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edward Hall, son of John Hall and Martha Gouldsmith, was born 15 July 1697, married
Avarilla Carvil on 31 October 1717. His will is recorded in 1742, he did not, it appears,
reside at Cranberry Hall which his son, John, occupied as he was in his father's will already
called of Cranberry Hall and in 1744, Edward's brother, Colonel John Hall, purchased of his
widow the tract in which he had resided for 330 pounds of sterling, namely a tract of land
called Hall's Park which he had in 1730 laid out and surveyed containing 1152 acres. Besides
bequeathing to his son, John, all his part of a tract of land called Cranberry Hall, he gave
him his plantation in the forest called Rich Neck and to his daughter Martha, the tract known as
Betty's Choice.
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Captain John Hall of Cranberry, son of Edward and Avarilla Carvil, was born 8 June 1719,
after the dissolution of his marriage to Sarah Hughes, he married Mrs. Barthia (Bethia)
Stansbury. He resided on Cranberry his entire life; he died 30 July 1779 and she died 10 July
1780 and were buried in the burying ground on that land which was located on a knoll near the
present home of Mr. Julian Mitchell. This land was later bought from the Lemon Family,
descendants of John Hall, by Morgan Mitchell at which time the Halls were removed from the
private burying ground to Spesutia Church, Perryman, Maryland. John Hall was a Captain in the
War for Freedom.

<center>Why you have a family name and what it means to you.</center><br>
</a>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Primitive personal names doubtless originated soon after the invention of
spoken language, although the date of their first use is lost in the darkness of ages preceding
recorded history. For thousands of years thereafter, first names were the only designations that
men and women bore; and in the historic times, when the world was less crowded than it is today,
and every man knew his neighbor, only one title of address was necessary. Only gradually, with
the passing of centuries and the increasing complexity of civilized society, did a need arise
for more specific designations.
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the root of our system of family names may be traced back to early
civilized times, actually, the hereditary surname as we know it today is a comparitively recent
development in human history dating from a time scarcely earlier than nine hundred years ago.
A surname is a name added to a baptismal or Christian name for the purpose of making it more
specific and of indicating family relationship or descent. Classified according to origin, most
surnames fall into four general categories: <br>
1. Those from the given name of the sire; <br>
2. Those arising from bodily or personal characteristics; <br>
3. Those derived from locality or place of residence; <br>
4. Those derived from occupation.
<br><br>
&nbsp;It is easier to understand the story of the development of our
institution of our surnames if these classifications are borne into mind.

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As early as biblical times, certain distinguishing appelations were
occasionally employed in addition to the given name, as for instance, Joshua the son of Nun,
Simon the son of Jonas, Judas of Galilee and Simon the Zealot. In ancient Greece, daughters were
scrupulously named after their fathers, as Chryseis, the daughter of Chryses; and son's names
were usually an enlarged form of their father's, as Hieronymus, son of Hiero.
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Romans, with the rise of their civilization, felt the need for some
hereditary title; and to meet this need they invented a complex system whereby every patrician
traced his descent by taking several names. None of these, however, exactly corresponded to
surnames as we know them, for the &quot;Clan Name&quot;, though hereditary, was given also to
slaves and other dependants. Excellent as this system was, it proved to be but a temporary
innovation, for the overthrow of the Western Empire by barbarian invaders brought about its end
and a reversion to the primitive custom of a single name.
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True surnames, in the sense of hereditary designations, date in England
from about the year 1000. Largely, they were introduced from Normandy, although there are
interesting records of Saxon surnames prior to the Norman Conquest. Perhaps the oldest surname
in England is that borne to Hwita Hatte, a keeper of bees, whose daughter was Tate Hatte. During
the reign of Edward the Confessor (1042-1066), there were Saxon tenants in Suffolk bearing such
names as Suert Magno, Stigand Soror, Siuward Rufus, and Leuric Hobbesune 'Hobson'; and the
Doomesday record of 1085-1086, which exhibits some curious combinations of Saxon surnames with
Norman family names, shows surnames in still more general use.
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the end of the twelfth century, hereditary names had become common in
England, but even by 1465, they were not universal. During the reign of Edward V, a law was
passed to compel certain Irish outlaws to adopt surnames; &quot;They shall take unto them a
surname, either of some town or some colour as Blacks or Brown, or some art or science as Smith
or Carpenter; or some office, as Cooks or Butler.&quot; And as late as the beginning of the
nineteenth century, a somewhat similar decree compelled Jews in Germany and Austria to add a
German surname to the single names which they previously used. 
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated above, family names may be divided into four classes according
to their origin. One of the largest classes of surnames are those derived from the given name of
the father of those who first bore the surname. Such names were formed by means of an added
prefix or suffix denoting &quot;Son of&quot; or a dimunitive. English names terminating in
&quot;son&quot;, &quot;ing&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; (from the Norse &quot;sonr&quot;,
&quot;ingr&quot;, &quot;kyn&quot;) are of this type, as are the host of names prefixed with
Gaelic &quot;Mac&quot;, the Norman &quot;Fitz&quot;, the Welsh &quot;Ap&quot;, and the Irish
&quot;O'&quot; (literally &quot;a descent of&quot;). Thus, John's sons became Johnsons;
William's sons became Williamsons or Wilsons; Richard's sons became Richardsons or Richardses
(the final &quot;s&quot; of &quot;Richards&quot; being a contraction of &quot;son&quot;);
Neill's sons, MacNeills; Herbert's sons, Fitzherberts; Thomas' sons, apThomases (Ap has been
dropped from many names of which it was formally a part); Reilly's sons, O'Reillys. Names of
this type are common not only in the British Isles, but also in Germany, the Netherlands, the
Scandinavian countries, and throughout many other parts of the world.
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another class of surnames, those arrising from some bodily or personal
characteristics of their first bearer, apparently grew out of what were in the first instance,
nicknames. Thus, Peter the Strong became Peter Strong; Roger of small stature became Roger
Little or Roger Small, and black haired William or blond Alfred became William Black or Alfred
White. From among the many names of this type, only a few need be mentioned: Long, Hardy, Wise,
Gladman, Lover, Youngman and Legrand. Such names as Fox and Wolfe perhaps also belong to this
group, although some writers suggest they may be of an ancient totemistic origin instead.
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While England enjoyed a period of comparative peace under Edward the
Confessor, a fourth class of surnames arose, names derived from occupations. The earliest of
these seem to have been official names, such as: Bishop, Mayor, Fawcett (Judge), Alderman, Reeve,
Sheriff, Chamberlain, Chancellor, Chaplin, Deacon, Latimer (Interceptor), Marshall, Sumner
(Summoner), and Parker (Park Keeper). Trade and craft names, although of the same general type,
were of somewhat later origin. Currier was a dresser of skins, Webster was a weaver, Wainwright
a wagon builder, and Baxter a barber. Such names as Smith, Taylor, Barber, Shepherd, Carter,
Mason, and Miller are self explanatory.
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many surnames of today which seem to defy classification or explanation
are corruptions of ancient forms which have been disguised almost beyond recognition. Longfellow,
for instance, was longueville; Longshanks was longchamps; Troublefield was Tubreville; Wrinch
was Renshaw; Diggles was Douglas; and Snooks was Sevenoakes. Such occupations of family names,
resulting from ignorance of spelling, variations in pronunciation, or merely from preference of
the bearer, tend to baffle the genealogist and the etymologist. Shakespear's name is found in
some twenty seven different forms, and the majority of English and Anglo, American surnames have,
in their history, appeared in four to a dozen or more variant spellings.
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In America, the melting pot of all nations, a greater variety of family
names exists than anywhere else in the world. Surnames of every race and nation are represented.
While the greater number are English, Scotch, Irish or Welsh origin, brought to this country by
scions of families which had borne these names for generations prior to emigration, many others,
from central and southern Europe and from Slavic countries, where the use of surnames is
generally a more recent established practice present considerable difficulty to the student of
etymology and family history.
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those Americans who bear old and honored names, who trace the history of
their surnames back to the sturdy emigrant ancestors, or even beyond, across the seas, and into
the dim mists of antiquity, may be rightfully proud of their heritage. While the name, in its
origin, may seem ingenious, humble, surprising, or matter-of-fact, its significance today lies
not in literal interpretation of its original meaning but in many things that have happened to
it since it first came into use. In the beginning, it was only a word, a convenient label to
distinguish one John from his neighbor John who lived accross the field. But soon it established
itself a part of the bearer's individuality; and it was passed to his children, his children's
children and their children, it became a symbol not of one man but of a family and all that
family stood for. Handed down from generation to generation, it grew inseparably associated with
the achievements, the tradition and the glory of the family. Like the Coat of Arms, that vivid
pictorial symbolization of the name which warrior ancestors bore in battle, the name itself,
borne through every event of life and through the lives of scores of one's progenitors, became
the badge of family honor, the &quot;good name&quot; to be proud of, to protect, and to fight
for if need be. As the valiant deeds of the marching generations have clothed it in glory, it
has become an institution, a family rallying cry, and the most treasured possession of those who
bear it.

<p><font face="Georgia">Transcript of a genealogy by Christopher
Johnston printed in the Maryland Historical Magazine, published
under the authority of the Maryland Historical Society Volume IX,
Baltimore, 1914, pp 72-88.<br>
1. DETMAR STERNBERG,1 the ancestor of this family, came to
Maryland, in 1658, with his wife Renske and his son Tobias. The
following record of his arrival has been preserved: &quot;1663. I
Detmoore Stairnber do assign over unto Thomas Bradley or his
assigns all my right and Title of land due unto me for . . .
myself who came in the year 1658, my wife Renscoe in 1658, John
Dowlin in 1663. Witness my hand this 19th of November 1663, and
also my son Tobias in 1658.&quot; <br>
(Signed) Detmorus Sternberge. (Land Office, Lib. 6, fol. 82.) <br>
15 December 1663, Thomas Bradley assigns to Henry Sewall, Esq.
the rights of a large number of persons, including &quot;Datmorus
Sternber, Renscoe and Tobias Sternber in 1658&quot; (ibid. fol.
84). While the name Sternberg is German, it should be borne in
mind that similar names frequently occur in Holland, whither many
families migrated from adjacent German territory. The name
&quot;Detmoore&quot; or, in the Latinized form
&quot;Detmorus,&quot; evidently stands for the well known Low
German name Detmar. The name of the immigrant's wife
&quot;Renscoe&quot; must stand for &quot;Renske,&quot; the Low
German or Dutch diminutive of Catherine. Detmar Sternberg settled
in Baltimore County, and was living there in 1678. He is
evidently the &quot;Dodman Sternbrough&quot; to whom there is
entered a credit of 40 lb. tobacco in the Baltimore County levy
of 1678 (Md. Arch., vii, 96). After this no further mention of
him occurs, and no will or administration appears on record. He
appears to have owned no land, and such estate as he possessed
was probably settled by family arrangement. Detmar1 and Renske
Sternberg had a son:-- <br>
2. i. TOBIAS STERNBERG2 or Starnborough, as the name appears on
the records. <br>
2. TOBIAS STARNBOROUGH2 (Detmar1) was brought to Maryland by his
parents in 1658. He was certainly a minor at the time, since his
father enters and disposes of his land rights, and he was
probably quite young. 26 April 1707, Tobias Starnborough,
&quot;aged 44 years or thereabouts,&quot; deposes that when he
first &quot;went a ranging,&quot; some twelve years previously,
one Daniel Welch told him that a certain tract of land was called
Maiden's Choice (Balto. Co. Resurveys, fol. 21). This record,
which would place the birth of Tobias in 1662 or 1663, can hardly
be correct, since it has been shown above that he was born before
1658, and besides the latter date does not accord with the fact
that his twin sons, Daniel and Thomas, were born in 1678. It is
to be noted, however, that in these depositions the age of the
deponent was often very perfunctorily recorded, as it did not
form a material part of the evidence. A number of cases can be
cited from the Chancery and other records where there is a
discrepancy of at least ten years. If, in the present case, a
similar error be assumed, and 54 years be read in the deposition
instead of 44, the birth of Tobias would be placed in 1652 or
1653, and with this all the other data harmonize. Assuming,
therefore, that Tobias was born in 1652-3, he would seem to have
acquired land at the age of about 17 years, no unusual
circumstance for an energetic lad at that time. 16 January
1670/1, by virtue of a warrant, dated 31 December 1670, to George
Yate of Anne Arundel County for 150 acres, whereof 100 acres were
assigned by the said Yate to Tobias Sternberge, a certificate of
survey issued to the said Tobias for 100 acres in Baltimore
County called Poplar Neck. The patent which folowed is dated 10
July 1671 (Land Office, Lib. 16, fol. 148). <br>
It is, of course, possible that Detmar Sternberg, who was then
living, purchased the assignment from Yate in his son's name. In
the Baltimore County Rent Roll, the date of survey of Poplar
Neck, which lay on the south side of Bear Creek, is given as 16
January 1672, and the possessor (about 1712) was Daniel
Stansbury. In 1681, Tobias Stanborrow is credited with 270 lb.
tobacco due to him in the levy of Baltimore County (Md. Arch.,
vii, 210). Tobias Starnborough was a member of the Grand Jury of
Baltimore County at March Court 1683/4 (Balto. Co., Lib. D., fol.
129). Under the existing law of the Province he must have been a
freeholder, and ought to have been at least 25 years of age. A
few years later he acquires more land. 29 June 1688, a tract of
135 acres called Huntington, on the north side of Patapsco River
in Baltimore County, was surveyed for Tobias Sternbridge (Balto.
Co. Rent Roll). This land was conveyed, 8 July 1695, by Tobias
Starnborough planter, of Baltimore County, and Sarah his wife, to
Richard Thompson of the same county (Balto. Co., Lib. RM. No. HS,
fol. 479). In 1692, Tobias Starnbarrow appears on the list of
taxables for the north side of the Patapsco (Balto Co., Lib. F,
no. 1, fol. 227). In 1694 his residence is more precisely
located. In that year the name of Tobias Starnborrow is found on
the list of taxables for Patapsco Hundred, on the south side of
Bear Creek (Balto. Co., Lib. G, no. 1, fol. 274). 30 July 1695, a
tract of 185 acres called Strife was surveyed for Tobias
Sternbrow &quot;between the branches of Back River and
Gunpowder&quot; (Balto. Co. Rent Roll). In this year he became a
&quot;ranger&quot; under Capt. John Oldton (Md. Arch, xx, 205), a
member of the force maintained by the Province to range or patrol
the outlying districts as a protection against Indians. In
October 1695, Tobias Standborrow of Baltimore County has an
allowance of 4200 lb. tobacco for seven months service as ranger
(Md. Arch, xix, 266). An allusion to his position as a ranger
will be found in his deposition cited above. He died in 1709. The
inventory of Tobias Starnbrough's estate was filed from Baltimore
county 3 August 1709 (Test. Proc., Lib. 21, fol. 175). It is
recorded at Annapolis in Inventories and Accounts, Lib. 29, fol.
408, and is signed by Robert Gorsuch as chief creditor, by Sarah
Starnbrough as administratrix, and by Luke Raven &quot;brother to
ye administratrix.&quot; At July Court 1710, Sarah Starnbrough
administratrix of Tobias Starnbrough filed her administration
bond (dated 23 April 1709) in common form, with Wm. Farfare and
John Barrett as her sureties (Test. Proc., Lib. 21, fol. 254).
Shortly after this the administratrix married Enoch Spinks and,
at October Court 1710, citation issued to said Enoch Spinks and
his wife, the administratrix of Tobias Starnbrough, to give new
security for the administration of the deceased's estate (ibid.
fol. 281). 15 July 1712, Sarah Spinks, administratrix of Tobias
Standburrough deceased, filed her account, and at August Court
1714, she gave bond to Samuel and Tabitha Stansbury, orphans of
Tobias Stansbury late of Baltimore County deceased, for their
filial portion of their father's estate (Baltimore County, Court
Record). Daniel, the eldest son of Tobias Stansbury, and his twin
brother Thomas were born in 1678, while the next child, Luke, was
not born until 1689. It is possible, therefore, that the two
elder sons were the offspring of a former wife, but there is no
other evidence that Tobias Stansbury was married more than once,
and Sarah was undoubtedly the mother of all the rest. Tobias
Starnborough2 had issue:-- <br>
3. i. DANIEL STANSBURY,3 b. 1678; d. April 1763. <br>
4. ii. THOMAS STANSBURY, twin of Daniel, b. 1678; d. 1766. <br>
5. iii. LUKE STANSBURY, b. 1689; d. 1742. <br>
6. iv. TOBIAS STANSBURY, b. 1691; d. 1764. <br>
7. v. SAMUEL STANSBURY, a minor in 1714. <br>
vi. TABITHA STANSBURY, a minor in 1714. <br>
3. DANIEL STANSBURY3 (Tobias,2 Detmar1) of Baltimore County, the
eldest son of his father, was born in 1678, and died in April
1763. The Annapolis Maryland Gazette of 7 April 1763, has this
obituary: &quot;Last week, died very suddenly in Baltimore
County, Mr. Daniel Stansbury, a native of that place, in the 85th
year of his age. He had eat a hearty supper the evening before he
died; and has left a twin brother.&quot; The twin brother can
only be Thomas, since all the other brothers are accounted for.
24 November 1713, Daniel Stansbrough executed a deed of gift to
his brother Thomas Stansbrough, of Daniel's Gift, 40 acres,
&quot;being part of a tract called Strife&quot; (Balto Co., Lib.
T. R. no. A, fol. 252). 7 November 1714, by virtue of a warrant
to Daniel Starborrough and Thomas Starborrough, both of Baltimore
County, dated 8 September 1714, to resurvey a tract in said
county called &quot;Strife,&quot; which was formerly granted to
their father, Tobias Starnborrough deceased, a certificate issued
to said Daniel for &quot;Strife&quot; now laid out for 268 acres.
On the same date and by virtue of the same warrant, and
&quot;whereas the said Daniel, as eldest son and heir to his
father, out of his fraternal love and affection for his brother
Thomas&quot; did grant to him by deed, dated 24 Nov. 1713, 40
acres part of Strife,--a certificate of resurvey issued to said
Thomas for Daniel's Gift now laid out for 127 acres (Original
Certificates in Land Office). The following children of
&quot;Daniel and Elizabeth Stansbury&quot; are entered in the
register of St. Paul's, Baltimore County, with exception of
William whose dates are derived from his epitaph. Daniel3 and
Elizabeth Stansbury had issue. <br>
8. i. WILLIAM STANSBURY,4 b. 20 Jan'y 1716; d. 3 Nov. 1788. <br>
9. ii. RICHARDSON STANSBURY, b. 20 May 1723; d. 1797. <br>
10. iii. RICHARD STANSBURY, b. 22 May 1725; d. 1791. <br>
11. iv. DANIEL STANSBURY, b. 23 July 1727. <br>
v. ELIZABETH STANSBURY, b. 21 Oct. 1730; m., 14 Jan'y 1749/50,<br>
Aquilla Gostwick. <br>
vi. ANNE STANSBURY, b. 26 Dec. 1735. <br>
4. THOMAS STANSBURY,3 (Tobias,2 Detmar1) was born in Baltimore
County in 1678, being the twin of his brother Daniel, and died 4
May 1766 (St. Paul's register). His brother's deed of gift,
containing proof of his affiliation has already been cited, and
the Baltimore County Rent Roll shows that a tract of 268 acres,
called &quot;Stansbury,&quot; was surveyed for him, 5 April 1724,
on the west side of Little Falls of Gunpowder. His will, dated 21
Feb'y 1748, confirmed 9 March 1763, and proved 4 June 1766
(Baltimore, Lib. 3, fol. 44) and the Baltimore County land
records show that he acquired a very considerable landed estate.
Thomas Stansbury3 and Jane (Dixon) his wife had issue (dates of
birth, &amp;c., from St. Paul's):-- <br>
12. i. JOHN STANSBURY,4 b. 1710; living 1785; named in his
father's will as eldest son. <br>
13. ii. THOMAS STANSBURY, b. 24 April 1714; d. 1798. <br>
14. iii. DANIEL STANSBURY of Anne Arundel Co., d. 1770. <br>
15. iv. DIXON STANSBURY, b. 6 Dec. 1720; d. 1805. <br>
16. v. EDMUND STANSBURY, b. 13 Jan'y 1724; d. 22 April 1780. <br>
vi. JEMIMA STANSBURY, b. 19 July 1727; m., 16 Aug. 1747, Roebuck
Lynch.<br>
5. LUKE STANSBURY3 (Tobias,2 Detmar1) was born in 1689, and died
in 1742. He gives his age as 44 years in 1733 (Balto. Co., Lib.
H. W. S. no. 3, fol. 188), 48 in 1737 (ib. H. W. S. no. 4, fol.
21), and 50 in 1739 (ibid., fol. 50). His will, dated 25 March
1742, was proved 7 May following (Balto., Lib. 1, fol. 345). 14
Dec. 1709, the year of his father's death, Sarah Stansbury
assigns to her &quot;son Luke Stansbury&quot; all her right and
title to a tract of 105 acres in Baltimore County called
&quot;The Lot,&quot; for which Tobias Starnborough had a
certificate dated 19 June 1705, and a patent issued, 1 Nov. 1710,
to Luke Stanborough, &quot;son of the said Tobias&quot; (Land
Office, Lib. D. D. no. 5, fol. 634). The patent recites that
Tobias Stanborough, of Baltimore County deceased, had surveyed
for him, 16 June 1705, a tract of 105 acres, by virtue of an
assignment for that amount from James Crooke, out of a warrant
for 500 acres granted to the said Crooke 20 Dec. 1704; that Sarah
Stanborough, administratrix of the said Tobias, assigned her
right and title to Luke Stanborough; and that the said 105 acres
is now patented to said Luke under the name of &quot;The
Lot&quot; (Land Office, Lib, P. L. no. 3, fol. 263). Jane, wife
of Luke Stansbury, survived her husband and died in 1759. Her
will, dated 16 April 1759, was proved 9 May following (Balto.,
Lib. 2, fol. 304). They had issue:-- <br>
17. i. CAPT. TOBIAS STANSBURY,4 b. 23 March 1718/19; d. Oct.
1757. <br>
ii. LUKE STANSBURY, b. 26 Dec. 1735. <br>

v. RUTH STANSBURY, b. 20 Jan'y 1728/9. <br>
6. TOBIAS STANSBURY3 (Tobias,2 Detmar1) was born in 1691 and died
in 1764. He gives his age, in depositions, as 42 years in 1733
(Balto. Co., Lib. H. W. S. no. 3, fol. 187), as 56 in 1746 (ib.
Lib. H. W. S. no. 4, fol. 128), and as 60 in 1746 (ibid., fol.
142, 160). In the last deposition cited, he states that he was
with his &quot;uncle Luke Raven&quot; when he ran a certain
survey &amp;c., and the fact that he was a nephew of Luke Raven
affords proof of his parentage. His will, dated 6 Jan'y 1762, was
proved 7 August 1764 (Balto., Lib. 2, fol. 167). Tobias
Stansbury3 and Honor (Bowen) his wife had issue (dates from St.
Paul's register) as follows:-- <br>
18. i. TOBIAS STANSBURY4 of Patapsco Neck, b. 11 Feb'y 1726/7; d.
10 Dec. 1799. <br>
19. ii. GEORGE STANSBURY, b. 3 July 1732; d. 1789. <br>

iv. AVERILLA STANSBURY, b. 9 Oct. 1723. <br>
v. HONOR STANSBURY, m. -- Gambrill. <br>
vi. SOPHIA STANSBURY, m. -- Robinson. <br>
7. SAMUEL STANSBURY3 (Tobias,2 Detmar1) was, with his sister
Tabitha, a minor in 1714, and their mother Sarah, who had married
her second husband, Enoch Spinks, gave bond for the payment of
their filial portions of their father's estate. 20 November 1719,
Samuel Stansbury of Baltimore County had a certificate for 100
acres on the south side of the Great Falls of Gunpowder River in
Baltimore County, by virtue of a warrant issued to the said
Samuel 29 Sept. 1719 (Land Office, Lib. I. L. no. A, fol. 24).
This tract, under the name Long Island, was surveyed 20 Nov. 1720
(Balto. Co. Rent Roll). Samuel Stansbury's will, dated 19 April
1783, was proved 9 May following (Balto., Lib. 3, fol. 547). He
leaves to his grandson Wm. Welch, after his mother's decease part
of The Addition, on the south side of Towson's River.--Remainder
of said tract to Solomon Stansbury.--&#156;50 to John Ensor
Stansbury, son of William Stansbury.--To my son Jasper Stansbury
Colston and my daughter Ruth Stansbury Colston, &#156;50.--To my
daughter Tabitha Cross, &#156;100.--To Delia Standifer,
&#156;50.--To Zebedee Hicks, &#156;50.--To Solomon and Luke
Stansbury, &#156;50 each.--To Matthias Galloy and Ruth Hicks,
each one shilling.--To my daughter Polly Stansbury Colston,
&#156;20.-- John Ensor Stansbury executor.--Witness: Benj.
Stansbury, John Talbot Risteau, William Stansbury. John Ensor
Stansbury, who is appointed executor, was the son of William4
(Daniel,3 Tobias,2 Detmar1) and the great nephew of the testator.
Tabitha Cross was doubtless Samuel's daughter, but the Colstons,
whom he calls his son and daughters, seem rather to have been his
grandchildren. As for the other legatees, it is difficult to
trace their connection with the testator, and it is probably
safer to attempt no further interpretation of the will without
additional information. <br>
<br>
8. WILLIAM STANSBURY4 (Daniel,3 Tobias,2 Detmar1) was born 20
January 1716, and died 3 November 1788 in his 73rd year
(Epitaph). His father dying intestate, William, as son and heir,
made provision for two of his brothers. 25 April 1763, William
Stansbury of Baltimore County, planter, son and heir-at-law of
Daniel Stansbury, late of said county deceased, and Elizabeth,
wife of said William, convey to Richard Stansbury, son of said
Daniel deceased, tract Poplar Neck, 100 acres, on Bear Creek, in
Baltimore County (Balto. Co., Lib. B. U. no. L, fol. 350). Also
25 April 1763, the same parties convey to Daniel Stansbury,
another son of said Daniel deceased, tract Prospect, 80 acres, on
Back River, in Baltimore County (ibid. fol. 353). William
Stansbury married, 14 Feb'y 1739/40, Elizabeth daughter of John
Ensor. She was born 12 July 1721, and died 10 Sept. 1799
(Epitaph). Her father in his will, dated 10 April 1771, and
proved 11 March 1773 (Balto., Lib. 3, fol. 240), leaves a bequest
to his &quot;grandson John Ensor Stansbury, son of my daughter
Elizabeth Stansbury.&quot; William Stansbury4 and Elizabeth
(Ensor) his wife had issue:-- <br>
i. WILLIAM STANSBURY,5 b. 4 April 1746; d. 1826; m. Belinda --
(b. 1750; d. 7 April 1830). <br>
20. ii. ABRAHAM STANSBURY, b --; d. 1811. <br>

viii. ELIZABETH STANSBURY, m. James Edwards. <br>
9. RICHARDSON STANSBURY4 (Daniel,3 Tobias,2 Detmar1) is doubtless
correctly placed here, but a word of explanation is necessary.
The register of St. Paul's Parish records that Richard Stansbury,
son of Daniel and Elizabeth, was born 20 May 1723. A later hand
has converted &quot;Richard&quot; into &quot;Richardson.&quot;
That the clerk who made the original entry accidentally dropped
the final syllable &quot;son,&quot; is probable enough, as it is
an error specially easy to make; and the person who made the
correction seems to have been well informed. Richardson Stansbury
lived in Back River Neck with the other sons of Daniel. He was
undoubtedly a grandson of Tobias, and a careful examination fails
to to find a place for him elsewhere than among the sons of
Daniel. In a deposition, made in 1773, he gives his age as 50
years (Balto. Co., A. L. No. R, 272) which agrees precisely with
the record of birth in St. Paul's register. Richardson Stansbury
married, 23 February 1747, Mary daughter of Isaac Raven (d. 1757)
of Baltimore County, and Letitia his wife daughter of Joseph Ward
(d. 1754) of Back River Neck. The will of &quot;Richardson
Stansbury of Back River Neck, in Baltimore County&quot; is dated
30 January 1797, and was proved 22 April following (Balto., Lib.
5, fol. 507). In it he names the children given below, makes his
grandson William Boswell one of his residuary legatees, and
appoints his son Isaac his executor. Richardson Stansbury4 and
Mary (Raven) his wife had issue:-- <br>
i. JOSEPH WARD STANSBURY,5 b. 24 Jan'y 1749; living 1797. <br>
ii. ISAAC STANSBURY, executor of his father's will, 1797. <br>

10. RICHARD STANSBURY4 (Daniel,3 Tobias,2 Detmar1) was born 22
May 1725, and died in 1791. He had a deed of gift, 25 April 1763,
from his brother William of a tract of 100 acres in Baltimore
County called Poplar Neck, and this tract was, at Richard's
death, divided among his four sons by deed of partition recorded
in Baltimore County. His will, dated 28 May 1791 and proved 6
October following (Balto. Lib. 5, fol. 11), names his wife Sarah
and the four sons and three daughters given below. The Maryland
Journal of 2 July 1782 has this obituary: &quot;Died. In the
prime of life, Mr. Solomon Stansbury and his two sisters, viz:
Sarah and Elizabeth, son and daughters of Richard Stansbury of
Patapsco Neck, a few days ago were drowned by the oversetting of
a canoe in the River&quot; &amp;c. &amp;c. In addition to these
three, Richard Stansbury and Sarah his wife had issue:-- <br>
i. DANIEL STANSBURY.5 <br>
ii. THOMAS STANSBURY, b. 2 Sept. 1770. <br>
22. iii. JOSIAS STANSBURY, d. 26 April 1825. <br>
iv. JOSHUA STANSBURY. <br>
v. KEZIAH STANSBURY. <br>
vi. TABITHA STANSBURY. <br>
vii. PRISCILLA STANSBURY. <br>
11. DANIEL STANSBURY4 (Daniel,3 Tobias,2 Detmar1) of Patapsco
Neck, Baltimore County, was born 23 July 1727, and died in
October or November 1803. His father, Daniel, having died
intestate, and therefore without making provision for his younger
sons, his eldest brother, William, conveyed to him by deed of
gift, dated 25 April 1763, a tract of 80 acres called Prospect,
on Back River (Balto. Co., Lib. B. no. L, fol. 353), and 20 April
1768, Aquilla Gostwick and Elizabeth his wife conveyed to
&quot;Daniel Stansbury son of Daniel&quot; a tract of 100 acres
called Adventure (ib. Lib. A. L. no. A, fol. 39). In his will,
dated 26 October, and proved 26 November, 1803 (Balto. Lib. 7,
fol. 256), he leaves to his eldest son Daniel the tract
&quot;Adventure which I purchased of Aquilla Gorsuch&quot;
(sic!); to his son William, the tract Force &quot;which I now
live on&quot;; and leaves legacies to his daughters Rebecca Bowen
and Elizabeth Phipps, and to his granddaughter Averilla Bowen.
The witnesses are Josias Stansbury, Joshua Stansbury, and Thomas
Jones, the first two being his nephews, sons of his brother
Richard. Testator's wife is not mentioned and was presumably
dead. Daniel Stansbury4 had issue: <br>
i. DANIEL STANSBURY.5 <br>
ii. WILLIAM STANSBURY.5 <br>
iii. REBECCA STANSBURY, m. -- Bowen. <br>
iv. ELIZABETH STANSBURY, m. -- Phipps. <br>
12. JOHN STANSBURY4 (Thomas,3 Tobias,2 Detmar1) is named in his
father's will as his eldest son. In a deposition made in 1785 he
gives his age as 75 years and mentions his father Thomas
Stansbury (Balto. Co., W. G. no. Y, 190). He was born, therefore,
about 1710, and he probably died not many years after 1785. He
married, 12 Feb'y 1734, Ann Ensor, and had issue (with perhaps
others):-- <br>
i. JANE STANSBURY,5 b. 26 June 1736. <br>
ii. JOHN STANSBURY, b. 23 Jan'y 1737/8. <br>
iii. ELIZABETH STANSBURY, b. 25 Feb'y 1739. <br>
13. THOMAS STANSBURY4 (Thomas,3 Tobias,2 Detmar1) was born 24
April 1714, and died in 1798. In his will, proved 30 June 1798
and recorded in Baltimore, he names the children given below. He
married, 2 March 1735, Hannah daughter of Charles Gorsuch and
Sarah Coale his wife. They had issue (order of birth uncertain): <br>
i. CHARLES STANSBURY, b. 24 Jan'y 1736. <br>
ii. LUKE STANSBURY, dead in 1798, leaving a widow Catherine. <br>
iii. BENJAMIN STANSBURY. <br>

July 1774, William Wilson (b. 1749; d. 30 March 1824). <br>
x. RACHEL STANSBURY, m. -- Lemon. <br>
14. DANIEL STANSBURY4 (Thomas,3 Tobias,2 Detmar1) of Anne Arundel
County was probably born about 1716-18, though this is largely
conjectural, and died in December 1769. His will, dated 22
December 1769, was proved 29 January 1770 (Annapolis, Lib. 37,
fol. 487) and mentions testator's wife Elizabeth and his children
as given below. He married, about 1740, Elizabeth (b. 24 Dec.
1718) daughter of John Ashman (d. 1737) of Anne Arundel County
and Constant his wife daughter of John Wilmot (d. 1719) of
Baltimore County. Daniel Stansbury4 and Elizabeth (Ashman) his
wife had issue (dates from St. Margaret's, A. A. Co.): <br>
23. i. EZEKIEL STANSBURY,5 b. 13, March 1740/1; d. December 1789.
<br>
24. ii. EMANUEL STANSBURY, b. 21 Feb'y 1743/4; d. 1790. <br>
25. iii. JOSEPH STANSBURY, b. 19 Feb'y 1745/6; d. Dec. 1798. <br>

vi. BENJAMIN STANSBURY, b. 9 Dec. 1754. <br>
vii. PATIENCE STANSBURY, b. 14 July 1757. <br>
15. DIXON STANSBURY4 (Thomas,3 Tobias,2 Detmar1) was born 6 Dec.
1720, and died in 1805. He married, 4 January 1740/1, Penelope
(b. 27 Nov. 1724) daughter of Stephen and Elizabeth Body (St.
Paul's, Balto. Co.). His will, dated 19 March 1805, was proved 4
December following (Balto., Lib. 8, fol. 10). His wife is not
mentioned in it, and she was doubtless dead at the time. Dixon
Stansbury4 and Penelope (Body) his wife had issue: <br>

16. EDMUND STANSBURY4 (Thomas,3 Tobias,2 Detmar1) was born 13
January 1724/5, and died 22 April 1780. He died intestate, and
letters of administration were issued, 12 January 1781, to Joseph
Cromwell, with Wm. Cromwell and Thomas Miles as sureties (Balto.
Administrations, Lib. 1, fol. 181). Edmund Stansbury married,
about 1775, Keziah Gostwick (b. 1753, d. 7 July 1809) who
survived him and married, secondly, Joseph Cromwell (b. about
1743, d. 12 Nov. 1800). Edmund Stansbury4 and Keziah Gostwick his

17. CAPT. TOBIAS STANSBURY4 (Luke,3 Tobias,2 Detmar1) was born 23
March 1718/9, and died in October 1757. The Annapolis Maryland
Gazette of 20 October 1757 has the following brief obituary:
&quot;A few days ago died, in Baltimore County, Capt. Tobias
Stansbury.&quot; He doubtless held a commission as Captain in the
County militia. His will dated 6 October 1757, was proved 31
March 1758 (Balto., Lib. 2, fol. 68). Tobias Stansbury married,
27 April 1746, Mary Hammond, daughter of Thomas Hammond of Queen
Anne County and Catherine Emerson his wife. Thomas Hammond, born
19 Dec. 1693, was the son of William, and the grandson of Maj.
Gen. John Hammond. The record of Tobias Stansbury's marriage and
of the births of his children may be found in the register of St.
Paul's, Baltimore, with exception of Gen. Tobias Emerson
Stansbury, whose birth is not entered. There is, however, ample
proof that Gen Stansbury was the unborn child mentioned in his
father's will. Capt. Tobias Stansbury4 and Mary (Hammond) his
wife had issue: <br>

His will, dated 19 August 1811, was proved 2 October following
(Balto., Lib. 9, fol. 174). His wife was named Elizabeth, as
appears from the register of St. James' Parish, Baltimore County,
where the births of four of their children are recorded, but her
surname is unknown. She may, however, have been an Edwards, as
may be conjectured from the fact that no less than three of their
nine children bear this name. Abraham Stansbury5 and Elizabeth
his wife had issue:-- <br>

(d. 1798) and Anne Rigbie his wife. They had issue:-- <br>

and married secondly, 28 August 1796, Thomas Greenwood. Ezekiel
Stansbury died intestate, and his widow Keziah filed her bond for
the administration of his estate 5 January 1790 (Balto. Admin.
Bonds, Lib. 7, fol. 242), her sureties being Emanuel Stansbury
and John Eager Howard. From the date of the bond, it would appear
that Ezekiel had died in the course of the preceding month,
December. Ezekiel Stansbury5 and Keziah his wife had issue:-- <br>
