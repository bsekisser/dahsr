[FAMILY]Adam &amp; Eve
[DOC]Preface
<tr><td align="left" class="text" width="100%">
It is a common misconception that all the families of earth came from Adam and Eve.
In chapter 1 of Genesis, on the sixth day, all the races of the earth, red, white,
yellow and black, were created, and then God rested on the seventh day.
But then, in chapter 2, on the eighth day, God created another race, a farmer,
a &quot;Husbandman&quot;, he called him Adam, and then he formed Eve from Adam's
&quot;rib&quot;, and these are the progenitors of the Hebrews of which, through David,
the King of Israel, came our Lord and Saviour, <span class="rtxt">Jesus Christ</span>!
