&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is not definitely known from which of the many illustrious
lines of the family in England, the first emigrants of the of the name to America were first
descended, it is generally believed that all of the Hughes Families were of extremely ancient
and honorable lineage, therefore, it cannot be determined who was the progenitor of Matthias
Hughes, our ancestor, however, after careful perusal of the Ancient Maryland Land Records and
Testamentary proceedings, it has been definitely estlablished that Matthias was our earliest
ancestor in America. Having been transported to Calvert County in 1667 in the Province of
Maryland and was granted upon his demand 50 acres of land due unto him for his servitude on 14
Feb 1669, which land he assigned unto Walter Greene of Calvert County the same year. The Will of
Matthias, dated 21 Jan 1702, indicates that his children were; Samuel, John, Sarah and Margaret.
The records of Saint James Parish,<br>
Herring Creek, Lothian, Ann Arundel County, Maryland indicate that Sarah Hewes, wife of Matthias
Hewes died 15 Mar 1697 and was buried 17 Mar 1697. The grave yard of Saint James Parish was
established in 1696.
