<p align="left"><font face="Georgia">While it is not definitely
known from which of the many illustrious lines of the family in
England, the first emigrants of the of the name to America were
first descended, it is generally believed that all of the Hughes
Families were of extremely ancient and honorable lineage,
therefore, it cannot be determined who was the progenitor of
Matthias Hughes, our ancestor, however, after careful perusal of
the Ancient Maryland Land Records and Testamentary proceedings,
it has been definitely estlablished that Matthias was our
earliest ancestor in America. Having been transported to Calvert
County in 1667 in the Province of Maryland and was granted upon
his demand 50 acres of land due unto him for his servitude on 14
Feb 1669, which land he assigned unto Walter Greene of Calvert
County the same year. The </font><a href="will.htm"><font

dated 21 Jan 1702, indicates that his children were; Samuel,
John, Sarah and Margaret. The records of Saint James Parish,<br>
Herring Creek, Lothian, Ann Arundel County, Maryland indicate
that Sarah Hewes, wife of Matthias Hewes died 15 Mar 1697 and was
buried 17 Mar 1697. The grave yard of Saint James Parish was
established in 1696.</font></p>
