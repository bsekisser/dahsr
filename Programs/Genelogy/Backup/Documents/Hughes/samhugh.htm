<h1 align="center"><font face="Georgia"><u>Samuel Hughes</u></font></h1>

<p align="left"><font face="Georgia">Samuel Hughes, who was
transported to Dorchester County in 1669, is believed, in all
probability, to be the brother of Matthias Hughes. Samuels wife,
Ann, was transported to Baltimore County in 1673. Upon the
erection of Baltimore County, 12 December 1659, by authority of
the provincial County of Maryland with it's many valuable land
opportunities for the new settlers, it is believed that after
Samuel's period of servitude was completed for transportations to
Dorchester County that he moved up the bay and settled in the new
county along the Chesapeake below Spesutia Island, now a part of
Aberdeen Proving Ground. This is proven by the fact that upon the
transportation of Ann in 1673 she is styled the wife of Samuel
Hughes of Baltimore County, further of the following land records
as found in Maryland land records office, Annapolis in Libre MM
18 Folio 27.</font></p>
