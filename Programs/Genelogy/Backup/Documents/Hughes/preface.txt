Primitive personal names
doubtless originated soon after the invention of spoken language,
although the date of their first use is lost in the darkness of
ages preceding recorded history. For thousands of years
thereafter, first names were the only designations that men and
women bore; and in the historic times, when the world was less
crowded than it is today, and every man knew his neighbor, only
one title of address was necessary. Only gradually, with the
passing of centuries and the increasing complexity of civilized
society, did a need arise for more specific designations.

<br><br>

While the root of our system
of family names may be traced back to early civilized times,
actually, the hereditary surname as we know it today is a
comparitively recent development in human history dating from a
time scarcely earlier than nine hundred years ago. A surname is a
name added to a baptismal or Christian name for the purpose of
making it more specific and of indicating family relationship or
descent. Classified according to origin, most surnames fall into
four general categories: <br>
1. Those from the given name of the sire; <br>
2. Those arising from bodily or personal characteristics; <br>
3. Those derived from locality or place of residence; <br>
and...<br>
4. Those derived from occupation.<br><br>
It is easier to understand the story of the development of our
institution of our surnames if these classifications are borne
into mind.

<br><br>

As early as biblical times,
certain distinguishing appelations were occasionally employed in
addition to the given name, as for instance, Joshua the son of
Nun, Simon the son of Jonas, Judas of Galilee and Simon the
Zealot. In ancient Greece, daughters were scrupulously named
after their fathers, as Chryseis, the daughter of Chryses; and
son's names were usually an enlarged form of their father's, as
Hieronymus, son of Hiero.

<br><br>

The Romans, with the rise of
their civilization, felt the need for some hereditary title; and
to meet this need they invented a complex system whereby every
patrician traced his descent by taking several names. None of
these, however, exactly corresponded to surnames as we know them,
for the &quot;Clan Name&quot;, though hereditary, was given also
to slaves and other dependants. Excellent as this system was, it
proved to be but a temporary innovation, for the overthrow of the
Western Empire by barbarian invaders brought about its end and a
reversion to the primitive custom of a single name.

<br><br>

True surnames, in the sense
of hereditary designations, date in England from about the year
1000. Largely, they were introduced from Normandy, although there
are interesting records of Saxon surnames prior to the Norman
Conquest. Perhaps the oldest surname in England is that borne to
Hwita Hatte, a keeper of bees, whose daughter was Tate Hatte.
During the reign of Edward the Confessor (1042-1066), there were
Saxon tenants in Suffolk bearing such names as Suert Magno,
Stigand Soror, Siuward Rufus, and Leuric Hobbesune 'Hobson'; and
the Doomesday record of 1085-1086, which exhibits some curious
combinations of Saxon surnames with Norman family names, shows
surnames in still more general use.

<br><br>

By the end of the twelfth
century, hereditary names had become common in England, but even
by 1465, they were not universal. During the reign of Edward V, a
law was passed to compel certain Irish outlaws to adopt surnames;
&quot;They shall take unto them a surname, either of some town or
some colour as Blacks or Brown, or some art or science as Smith
or Carpenter; or some office, as Cooks or Butler.&quot; And as
late as the beginning of the nineteenth century, a somewhat
similar decree compelled Jews in Germany and Austria to add a
German surname to the single names which they previously used.

<br><br>

As stated above, family
names may be divided into four classes according to their origin.
One of the largest classes of surnames are those derived from the
given name of the father of those who first bore the surname.
Such names were formed by means of an added prefix or suffix
denoting &quot;Son of&quot; or a dimunitive. English names
terminating in &quot;son&quot;, &quot;ing&quot; and
&quot;kin&quot; (from the Norse &quot;sonr&quot;,
&quot;ingr&quot;, &quot;kyn&quot;) are of this type, as are the
host of names prefixed with Gaelic &quot;Mac&quot;, the Norman
&quot;Fitz&quot;, the Welsh &quot;Ap&quot;, and the Irish
&quot;O'&quot; (literally &quot;a descent of&quot;). Thus, John's
sons became Johnsons; William's sons became Williamsons or
Wilsons; Richard's sons became Richardsons or Richardses (the
final &quot;s&quot; of &quot;Richards&quot; being a contraction
of &quot;son&quot;); Neill's sons, MacNeills; Herbert's sons,
Fitzherberts; Thomas' sons, apThomases (Ap has been dropped from
many names of which it was formally a part); Reilly's sons,
O'Reillys. Names of this type are common not only in the British
Isles, but also in Germany, the Netherlands, the Scandinavian
countries, and throughout many other parts of the world.

<br><br>

Another class of surnames,
those arrising from some bodily or personal characteristics of
their first bearer, apparently grew out of what were in the first
instance, nicknames. Thus, Peter the Strong became Peter Strong;
Roger of small stature became Roger Little or Roger Small, and
black haired William or blond Alfred became William Black or
Alfred White. From among the many names of this type, only a few
need be mentioned: Long, Hardy, Wise, Gladman, Lover, Youngman
and Legrand. Such names as Fox and Wolfe perhaps also belong to
this group, although some writers suggest they may be of an
ancient totemistic origin instead.

<br><br>

While England enjoyed a
period of comparative peace under Edward the Confessor, a fourth
class of surnames arose, names derived from occupations. The
earliest of these seem to have been official names, such as:
Bishop, Mayor, Fawcett (Judge), Alderman, Reeve, Sheriff,
Chamberlain, Chancellor, Chaplin, Deacon, Latimer (Interceptor),
Marshall, Sumner (Summoner), and Parker (Park Keeper). Trade and
craft names, although of the same general type, were of somewhat
later origin. Currier was a dresser of skins, Webster was a
weaver, Wainwright a wagon builder, and Baxter a barber. Such
names as Smith, Taylor, Barber, Shepherd, Carter, Mason, and
Miller are self explanatory.

<br><br>

Many surnames of today which
seem to defy classification or explanation are corruptions of
ancient forms which have been disguised almost beyond
recognition. Longfellow, for instance, was longueville;
Longshanks was longchamps; Troublefield was Tubreville; Wrinch
was Renshaw; Diggles was Douglas; and Snooks was Sevenoakes. Such
occupations of family names, resulting from ignorance of
spelling, variations in pronunciation, or merely from preference
of the bearer, tend to baffle the genealogist and the
etymologist. Shakespear's name is found in some twenty seven
different forms, and the majority of English and Anglo, American
surnames have, in their history, appeared in four to a dozen or
more variant spellings.

<br><br>

In America, the melting pot
of all nations, a greater variety of family names exists than
anywhere else in the world. Surnames of every race and nation are
represented. While the greater number are English, Scotch, Irish
or Welsh origin, brought to this country by scions of families
which had borne these names for generations prior to emigration,
many others, from central and southern Europe and from Slavic
countries, where the use of surnames is generally a more recent
established practice present considerable difficulty to the
student of etymology and family history.

<br><br>

Those Americans who bear old
and honored names, who trace the history of their surnames back
to the sturdy emigrant ancestors, or even beyond, across the
seas, and into the dim mists of antiquity, may be rightfully
proud of their heritage. While the name, in its origin, may seem
ingenious, humble, surprising, or matter-of-fact, its
significance today lies not in literal interpretation of its
original meaning but in many things that have happened to it
since it first came into use. In the beginning, it was only a
word, a convenient label to distinguish one John from his
neighbor John who lived accross the field. But soon it
established itself a part of the bearer's individuality; and it
was passed to his children, his children's children and their
children, it became a symbol not of one man but of a family and
all that family stood for. Handed down from generation to
generation, it grew inseparably associated with the achievements,
the tradition and the glory of the family. Like the Coat of Arms,
that vivid pictorial symbolization of the name which warrior
ancestors bore in battle, the name itself, borne through every
event of life and through the lives of scores of one's
progenitors, became the badge of family honor, the &quot;good
name&quot; to be proud of, to protect, and to fight for if need
be. As the valiant deeds of the marching generations have clothed
it in glory, it has become an institution, a family rallying cry,
and the most treasured possession of those who bear it.
