<h1 align="center"><font face="Georgia"><u>The Hall Family</u></font></h1>

<p align="left"><font face="Georgia">A biographical sketch of the
early Halls has been prepared in order that the Hughes
descendants might know who they were, where they settled and the
fact that, had the Church of England recognized the marriage of
John Hall of Cranberry and Sarah Hughes, our name would have been
HALL instead of HUGHES.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Georgia">The Halls, when first
settling in the province of Maryland, were Roman Catholics but
some of the later generation became members of the Church of
England and removed from St. Mary's County. Of these latter we
find Captain John Hall who was born in 1658 and who, in 1694,
purchased certain tracts of land from Michael Judd on 8 August;
Edward Boothby, 26 May; and others sufficient to make up 1539
acres which he, that year, had surveyed, on the Bush River in the
northern part of Baltimore County. He had on the 18 July 1693 of
the year previous married Martha Gouldsmith nee Beadle. They had
seven children. The records of St.George's Parish state that
Madam Martha Hall died 4 February 1720, aged 52 years; John died
in August 1737. By his will, bearing date of 4 January 1737, he
bequeaths to his oldest surviving son, Edward, a part of a tract
of land on which he then lived, called Cranberry Hall, lying on
the east of the Mill Branch and also 600 acres on Deer Creek. To
his son, John, he leaves his lands lying on Spesutia and Mosquito
Creeks, Taylors Good Hope 400 acres and Timber Nest 470 acres. To
his son, Parker, that part of Cranberry Hall lying west of Mill
Run and Jerico 1000 acres. To his daughter, Sophia, a tract of
land called &quot;Sophia's Dowery&quot; parts of Hall's Plains
and Simon's Neglect. To his grandson, John, son of Aquilla, he
gives the new quarter containing 600 acres.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Georgia">Sophia Hall married Thomas
White prior to 1731; he was born in London in 1704, the son of
William White and Elizabeth Leigh. His father at one time
possessed a considerable patrimony; but having, it would seem,
parted with a large portion of it and died in 1708 at an early
age leaving a widow and five children. In 1720, Thomas sailed for
Maryland and there is reason to think that he was of the retinue
of Charles Calvert, the cousin of Lord Baltimore, who certainly
reached the New World in that year with a large company of
gentlemen to succeed Mr. Hart as governor of the province. We are
told on the authority of Bishop White that his father, when he
sailed, had been apprenticed to Mr. Stokes, the clerk of the
County of Baltimore. The fee of 100 Guineas was given this
gentlemen that he might bring the boy up to the profession of
law, having become a Deputy of Mr. Stokes and purchased books, he
practiced law and soon laid up the money with which he bought his
lands. Sophia and Thomas had 3 children; Sophia Hall, born 8 May
1731; Elizabeth born 28 January 1733; and Sarah Charlotte born 25
October 1736.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Georgia">Colonel White's wife,
Sophia, died 18 June 1742, and about 1745 he moved to
Philadelphia and on 7 May 1747, at Christ Church, he married
Esther, the widow of the late John Newman and daughter of Abraham
Hawlings of Burlington, New Jersey, a lady of much force of
character, coming of a family that among Quakers had constantly
adherred to the Church of England. By this marriage, Colonel
White had 2 children;<br>
William, Bishop of Philadelphia, born 24 March 1747, died 16 July
1836; Mary who was born in Philadelphia 13 April 1749, married
Robert Morris Jr., 2 March 1769, the future finacier of the
American Revolution. He was born in Liverpool, England, 31
January 1734. His father was Robert Morris who came to America
and settled on the eastern shore of Maryland and died there 12
July 1750. Robert Jr. then went to Philadelphia and entered the
counting house of Mr. Charles Willing, the first merchant of his
day, and in 1754 at the age of 20, formed a co-partnership with
his son, Thomas Willing, which lasted 39 years; and the firm of
Willing and Morris became the best known and largest importing
house in the Colonies.<br>
Robert Morris died 7 May 1806 and was placed in a vault at Christ
Church, second street, Philadelphia, Tuesday, 16 January 1827.
Colonel White died at Sophia's Dowery, 29 September 1779,
attended by his wife and son. Mr. White died Friday evening, 31
December 1790.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Georgia">Edward Hall, son of John
Hall and Martha Gouldsmith, was born 15 July 1697, married
Avarilla Carvil on 31 October 1717. His will is recorded in 1742,
he did not, it appears, reside at Cranberry Hall which his son,
John, occupied as he was in his father's will already called of
Cranberry Hall and in 1744, Edward's brother, Colonel John Hall,
purchased of his widow the tract in which he had resided for 330
pounds of sterling, namely a tract of land called Hall's Park
which he had in 1730 laid out and surveyed containing 1152 acres.
Besides bequeathing to his son, John, all his part of a tract of
land called Cranberry Hall, he gave him his plantation in the
forest called Rich Neck and to his daughter Martha, the tract
known as Betty's Choice.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Georgia">Captain John Hall of
Cranberry, son of Edward and Avarilla Carvil, was born 8 June
1719, after the dissolution of his marriage to Sarah Hughes, he
married Mrs. Barthia (Bethia) Stansbury. He resided on Cranberry
his entire life; he died 30 July 1779 and she died 10 July 1780
and were buried in the burying ground on that land which was
located on a knoll near the present home of Mr. Julian Mitchell.
This land was later bought from the Lemon Family, descendants of
John Hall, by Morgan Mitchell at which time the Halls were
removed from the private burying ground to Spesutia Church,
Perryman, Maryland. John Hall was a Captain in the War for
Freedom.</font></p>
