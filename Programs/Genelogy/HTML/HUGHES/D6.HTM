<u>&quot;The Will of Matthias Hughes&quot;</u>
</div>

<p>
In the name of God, Amen, the 21st day of January, 1702,
I, Matthias Hughes, of the Parish of St. James in the County of Anne Arundel, planter, being
sick and weak in body but of perfect mind and memory thanks be given to God and therefor and
calling to mind the mortality of my God knowing that it is appointed for account now and to pay
do make and ordain this my last will, that is to say:
</p>

<p>
FIRST: I give and recommend my soul unto the hands of God that gave it and for my body I commend
it to the earth to be buried in a like and decent manner under the direction of my executor
nothing doubting but at the great resurrection. I take reward the same again by the mighty power
of God and at leaving such worldly estate whatsoever it hath pleased God to possess me with in
this life I give and dispose of my land in manner and form following to wit:
</p>

<p>
I give and bequeath unto my dearly beloved sons, Samuel and John all
that tract of land called Papa Ridge to be equally divided between them, that is to say I give
unto my son Samuel Hughes, his heirs and assigns forever that half part on which Mr. Harsewood
resideth. I give and bequeath unto my son, John Hughes, his heirs and assigns forever the other
half of the said land.
</p>

<p>
I give unto my son Samuel one young calf of my young cow named Cherry
with all her female increase.
</p>

<p>
I give and bequeath unto my son John one mare and one cow named Catch
with all her female increase and one hand mill.
</p>

<p>
Is my will and desire that the four hogsheads of tobacco when sold from
Mr. Harsewood for the rent of my land be equally divided between my two sons Samuel and John
aforesaid.
</p>

<p>
I give unto Sarah Little one feather bed of furniture thereunto
belonging. I give and bequeath my son John unto the said Sarah Little to be carefully brought
up by her until he shall arrive to the age of nineteen years. Which so said Sarah Little I like,
write, constitute, make and ordain my only and last executor of this my last will and testament.
</p>

<p>
I give unto my daughters Sarah and Margaret, 12 pieces of sterling a piece and I do hereby
utterly disallow, revoke and disannul all and every former testament and wills, legacies and
bequests, executed by me in any way before this time named wills and requiring, ratifying and
confirming this and no other to be my last will and testament. In witness whereof I have
hereunto set my hand and seal this day and year above written signed and sealed published
pronounced and declared by the said Matthias Hughes as his last will and testament in the
presence of the subscribers, viz.;
