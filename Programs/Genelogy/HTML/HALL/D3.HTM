Transcript of a genealogy by Christopher
Johnston printed in the Maryland Historical Magazine, published
under the authority of the Maryland Historical Society Volume IX,
Baltimore, 1914, pp 72-88.<br>
1. DETMAR STERNBERG,1 the ancestor of this family, came to
Maryland, in 1658, with his wife Renske and his son Tobias. The
following record of his arrival has been preserved: &quot;1663. I
Detmoore Stairnber do assign over unto Thomas Bradley or his
assigns all my right and Title of land due unto me for . . .
myself who came in the year 1658, my wife Renscoe in 1658, John
Dowlin in 1663. Witness my hand this 19th of November 1663, and
also my son Tobias in 1658.&quot; <br>
(Signed) Detmorus Sternberge. (Land Office, Lib. 6, fol. 82.) <br>
15 December 1663, Thomas Bradley assigns to Henry Sewall, Esq.
the rights of a large number of persons, including &quot;Datmorus
Sternber, Renscoe and Tobias Sternber in 1658&quot; (ibid. fol.
84). While the name Sternberg is German, it should be borne in
mind that similar names frequently occur in Holland, whither many
families migrated from adjacent German territory. The name
&quot;Detmoore&quot; or, in the Latinized form
&quot;Detmorus,&quot; evidently stands for the well known Low
German name Detmar. The name of the immigrant's wife
&quot;Renscoe&quot; must stand for &quot;Renske,&quot; the Low
German or Dutch diminutive of Catherine. Detmar Sternberg settled
in Baltimore County, and was living there in 1678. He is
evidently the &quot;Dodman Sternbrough&quot; to whom there is
entered a credit of 40 lb. tobacco in the Baltimore County levy
of 1678 (Md. Arch., vii, 96). After this no further mention of
him occurs, and no will or administration appears on record. He
appears to have owned no land, and such estate as he possessed
was probably settled by family arrangement. Detmar1 and Renske
Sternberg had a son:-- <br>
2. i. TOBIAS STERNBERG2 or Starnborough, as the name appears on
the records. <br>
2. TOBIAS STARNBOROUGH2 (Detmar1) was brought to Maryland by his
parents in 1658. He was certainly a minor at the time, since his
father enters and disposes of his land rights, and he was
probably quite young. 26 April 1707, Tobias Starnborough,
&quot;aged 44 years or thereabouts,&quot; deposes that when he
first &quot;went a ranging,&quot; some twelve years previously,
one Daniel Welch told him that a certain tract of land was called
Maiden's Choice (Balto. Co. Resurveys, fol. 21). This record,
which would place the birth of Tobias in 1662 or 1663, can hardly
be correct, since it has been shown above that he was born before
1658, and besides the latter date does not accord with the fact
that his twin sons, Daniel and Thomas, were born in 1678. It is
to be noted, however, that in these depositions the age of the
deponent was often very perfunctorily recorded, as it did not
form a material part of the evidence. A number of cases can be
cited from the Chancery and other records where there is a
discrepancy of at least ten years. If, in the present case, a
similar error be assumed, and 54 years be read in the deposition
instead of 44, the birth of Tobias would be placed in 1652 or
1653, and with this all the other data harmonize. Assuming,
therefore, that Tobias was born in 1652-3, he would seem to have
acquired land at the age of about 17 years, no unusual
circumstance for an energetic lad at that time. 16 January
1670/1, by virtue of a warrant, dated 31 December 1670, to George
Yate of Anne Arundel County for 150 acres, whereof 100 acres were
assigned by the said Yate to Tobias Sternberge, a certificate of
survey issued to the said Tobias for 100 acres in Baltimore
County called Poplar Neck. The patent which folowed is dated 10
July 1671 (Land Office, Lib. 16, fol. 148). <br>
It is, of course, possible that Detmar Sternberg, who was then
living, purchased the assignment from Yate in his son's name. In
the Baltimore County Rent Roll, the date of survey of Poplar
Neck, which lay on the south side of Bear Creek, is given as 16
January 1672, and the possessor (about 1712) was Daniel
Stansbury. In 1681, Tobias Stanborrow is credited with 270 lb.
tobacco due to him in the levy of Baltimore County (Md. Arch.,
vii, 210). Tobias Starnborough was a member of the Grand Jury of
Baltimore County at March Court 1683/4 (Balto. Co., Lib. D., fol.
129). Under the existing law of the Province he must have been a
freeholder, and ought to have been at least 25 years of age. A
few years later he acquires more land. 29 June 1688, a tract of
135 acres called Huntington, on the north side of Patapsco River
in Baltimore County, was surveyed for Tobias Sternbridge (Balto.
Co. Rent Roll). This land was conveyed, 8 July 1695, by Tobias
Starnborough planter, of Baltimore County, and Sarah his wife, to
Richard Thompson of the same county (Balto. Co., Lib. RM. No. HS,
fol. 479). In 1692, Tobias Starnbarrow appears on the list of
taxables for the north side of the Patapsco (Balto Co., Lib. F,
no. 1, fol. 227). In 1694 his residence is more precisely
located. In that year the name of Tobias Starnborrow is found on
the list of taxables for Patapsco Hundred, on the south side of
Bear Creek (Balto. Co., Lib. G, no. 1, fol. 274). 30 July 1695, a
tract of 185 acres called Strife was surveyed for Tobias
Sternbrow &quot;between the branches of Back River and
Gunpowder&quot; (Balto. Co. Rent Roll). In this year he became a
&quot;ranger&quot; under Capt. John Oldton (Md. Arch, xx, 205), a
member of the force maintained by the Province to range or patrol
the outlying districts as a protection against Indians. In
October 1695, Tobias Standborrow of Baltimore County has an
allowance of 4200 lb. tobacco for seven months service as ranger
(Md. Arch, xix, 266). An allusion to his position as a ranger
will be found in his deposition cited above. He died in 1709. The
inventory of Tobias Starnbrough's estate was filed from Baltimore
county 3 August 1709 (Test. Proc., Lib. 21, fol. 175). It is
recorded at Annapolis in Inventories and Accounts, Lib. 29, fol.
408, and is signed by Robert Gorsuch as chief creditor, by Sarah
Starnbrough as administratrix, and by Luke Raven &quot;brother to
ye administratrix.&quot; At July Court 1710, Sarah Starnbrough
administratrix of Tobias Starnbrough filed her administration
bond (dated 23 April 1709) in common form, with Wm. Farfare and
John Barrett as her sureties (Test. Proc., Lib. 21, fol. 254).
Shortly after this the administratrix married Enoch Spinks and,
at October Court 1710, citation issued to said Enoch Spinks and
his wife, the administratrix of Tobias Starnbrough, to give new
security for the administration of the deceased's estate (ibid.
fol. 281). 15 July 1712, Sarah Spinks, administratrix of Tobias
Standburrough deceased, filed her account, and at August Court
1714, she gave bond to Samuel and Tabitha Stansbury, orphans of
Tobias Stansbury late of Baltimore County deceased, for their
filial portion of their father's estate (Baltimore County, Court
Record). Daniel, the eldest son of Tobias Stansbury, and his twin
brother Thomas were born in 1678, while the next child, Luke, was
not born until 1689. It is possible, therefore, that the two
elder sons were the offspring of a former wife, but there is no
other evidence that Tobias Stansbury was married more than once,
and Sarah was undoubtedly the mother of all the rest. Tobias
Starnborough2 had issue:-- <br>
3. i. DANIEL STANSBURY,3 b. 1678; d. April 1763. <br>
4. ii. THOMAS STANSBURY, twin of Daniel, b. 1678; d. 1766. <br>
5. iii. LUKE STANSBURY, b. 1689; d. 1742. <br>
6. iv. TOBIAS STANSBURY, b. 1691; d. 1764. <br>
7. v. SAMUEL STANSBURY, a minor in 1714. <br>
vi. TABITHA STANSBURY, a minor in 1714. <br>
3. DANIEL STANSBURY3 (Tobias,2 Detmar1) of Baltimore County, the
eldest son of his father, was born in 1678, and died in April
1763. The Annapolis Maryland Gazette of 7 April 1763, has this
obituary: &quot;Last week, died very suddenly in Baltimore
County, Mr. Daniel Stansbury, a native of that place, in the 85th
year of his age. He had eat a hearty supper the evening before he
died; and has left a twin brother.&quot; The twin brother can
only be Thomas, since all the other brothers are accounted for.
24 November 1713, Daniel Stansbrough executed a deed of gift to
his brother Thomas Stansbrough, of Daniel's Gift, 40 acres,
&quot;being part of a tract called Strife&quot; (Balto Co., Lib.
T. R. no. A, fol. 252). 7 November 1714, by virtue of a warrant
to Daniel Starborrough and Thomas Starborrough, both of Baltimore
County, dated 8 September 1714, to resurvey a tract in said
county called &quot;Strife,&quot; which was formerly granted to
their father, Tobias Starnborrough deceased, a certificate issued
to said Daniel for &quot;Strife&quot; now laid out for 268 acres.
On the same date and by virtue of the same warrant, and
&quot;whereas the said Daniel, as eldest son and heir to his
father, out of his fraternal love and affection for his brother
Thomas&quot; did grant to him by deed, dated 24 Nov. 1713, 40
acres part of Strife,--a certificate of resurvey issued to said
Thomas for Daniel's Gift now laid out for 127 acres (Original
Certificates in Land Office). The following children of
&quot;Daniel and Elizabeth Stansbury&quot; are entered in the
register of St. Paul's, Baltimore County, with exception of
William whose dates are derived from his epitaph. Daniel3 and
Elizabeth Stansbury had issue. <br>
8. i. WILLIAM STANSBURY,4 b. 20 Jan'y 1716; d. 3 Nov. 1788. <br>
9. ii. RICHARDSON STANSBURY, b. 20 May 1723; d. 1797. <br>
10. iii. RICHARD STANSBURY, b. 22 May 1725; d. 1791. <br>
11. iv. DANIEL STANSBURY, b. 23 July 1727. <br>
v. ELIZABETH STANSBURY, b. 21 Oct. 1730; m., 14 Jan'y 1749/50,<br>
Aquilla Gostwick. <br>
vi. ANNE STANSBURY, b. 26 Dec. 1735. <br>
4. THOMAS STANSBURY,3 (Tobias,2 Detmar1) was born in Baltimore
County in 1678, being the twin of his brother Daniel, and died 4
May 1766 (St. Paul's register). His brother's deed of gift,
containing proof of his affiliation has already been cited, and
the Baltimore County Rent Roll shows that a tract of 268 acres,
called &quot;Stansbury,&quot; was surveyed for him, 5 April 1724,
on the west side of Little Falls of Gunpowder. His will, dated 21
Feb'y 1748, confirmed 9 March 1763, and proved 4 June 1766
(Baltimore, Lib. 3, fol. 44) and the Baltimore County land
records show that he acquired a very considerable landed estate.
Thomas Stansbury3 and Jane (Dixon) his wife had issue (dates of
birth, &amp;c., from St. Paul's):-- <br>
12. i. JOHN STANSBURY,4 b. 1710; living 1785; named in his
father's will as eldest son. <br>
13. ii. THOMAS STANSBURY, b. 24 April 1714; d. 1798. <br>
14. iii. DANIEL STANSBURY of Anne Arundel Co., d. 1770. <br>
15. iv. DIXON STANSBURY, b. 6 Dec. 1720; d. 1805. <br>
16. v. EDMUND STANSBURY, b. 13 Jan'y 1724; d. 22 April 1780. <br>
vi. JEMIMA STANSBURY, b. 19 July 1727; m., 16 Aug. 1747, Roebuck
Lynch.<br>
5. LUKE STANSBURY3 (Tobias,2 Detmar1) was born in 1689, and died
in 1742. He gives his age as 44 years in 1733 (Balto. Co., Lib.
H. W. S. no. 3, fol. 188), 48 in 1737 (ib. H. W. S. no. 4, fol.
21), and 50 in 1739 (ibid., fol. 50). His will, dated 25 March
1742, was proved 7 May following (Balto., Lib. 1, fol. 345). 14
Dec. 1709, the year of his father's death, Sarah Stansbury
assigns to her &quot;son Luke Stansbury&quot; all her right and
title to a tract of 105 acres in Baltimore County called
&quot;The Lot,&quot; for which Tobias Starnborough had a
certificate dated 19 June 1705, and a patent issued, 1 Nov. 1710,
to Luke Stanborough, &quot;son of the said Tobias&quot; (Land
Office, Lib. D. D. no. 5, fol. 634). The patent recites that
Tobias Stanborough, of Baltimore County deceased, had surveyed
for him, 16 June 1705, a tract of 105 acres, by virtue of an
assignment for that amount from James Crooke, out of a warrant
for 500 acres granted to the said Crooke 20 Dec. 1704; that Sarah
Stanborough, administratrix of the said Tobias, assigned her
right and title to Luke Stanborough; and that the said 105 acres
is now patented to said Luke under the name of &quot;The
Lot&quot; (Land Office, Lib, P. L. no. 3, fol. 263). Jane, wife
of Luke Stansbury, survived her husband and died in 1759. Her
will, dated 16 April 1759, was proved 9 May following (Balto.,
Lib. 2, fol. 304). They had issue:-- <br>
17. i. CAPT. TOBIAS STANSBURY,4 b. 23 March 1718/19; d. Oct.
1757. <br>
ii. LUKE STANSBURY, b. 26 Dec. 1735. <br>
iii. ELIZABETH STANSBURY, m. William Bond. <br>

</strong><br>
v. RUTH STANSBURY, b. 20 Jan'y 1728/9. <br>
6. TOBIAS STANSBURY3 (Tobias,2 Detmar1) was born in 1691 and died
in 1764. He gives his age, in depositions, as 42 years in 1733
(Balto. Co., Lib. H. W. S. no. 3, fol. 187), as 56 in 1746 (ib.
Lib. H. W. S. no. 4, fol. 128), and as 60 in 1746 (ibid., fol.
142, 160). In the last deposition cited, he states that he was
with his &quot;uncle Luke Raven&quot; when he ran a certain
survey &amp;c., and the fact that he was a nephew of Luke Raven
affords proof of his parentage. His will, dated 6 Jan'y 1762, was
proved 7 August 1764 (Balto., Lib. 2, fol. 167). Tobias
Stansbury3 and Honor (Bowen) his wife had issue (dates from St.
Paul's register) as follows:-- <br>
18. i. TOBIAS STANSBURY4 of Patapsco Neck, b. 11 Feb'y 1726/7; d.
10 Dec. 1799. <br>
19. ii. GEORGE STANSBURY, b. 3 July 1732; d. 1789. <br>
iii. BOWEN STANSBURY. <br>
iv. AVERILLA STANSBURY, b. 9 Oct. 1723. <br>
v. HONOR STANSBURY, m. -- Gambrill. <br>
vi. SOPHIA STANSBURY, m. -- Robinson. <br>
7. SAMUEL STANSBURY3 (Tobias,2 Detmar1) was, with his sister
Tabitha, a minor in 1714, and their mother Sarah, who had married
her second husband, Enoch Spinks, gave bond for the payment of
their filial portions of their father's estate. 20 November 1719,
Samuel Stansbury of Baltimore County had a certificate for 100
acres on the south side of the Great Falls of Gunpowder River in
Baltimore County, by virtue of a warrant issued to the said
Samuel 29 Sept. 1719 (Land Office, Lib. I. L. no. A, fol. 24).
This tract, under the name Long Island, was surveyed 20 Nov. 1720
(Balto. Co. Rent Roll). Samuel Stansbury's will, dated 19 April
1783, was proved 9 May following (Balto., Lib. 3, fol. 547). He
leaves to his grandson Wm. Welch, after his mother's decease part
of The Addition, on the south side of Towson's River.--Remainder
of said tract to Solomon Stansbury.--&#156;50 to John Ensor
Stansbury, son of William Stansbury.--To my son Jasper Stansbury
Colston and my daughter Ruth Stansbury Colston, &#156;50.--To my
daughter Tabitha Cross, &#156;100.--To Delia Standifer,
&#156;50.--To Zebedee Hicks, &#156;50.--To Solomon and Luke
Stansbury, &#156;50 each.--To Matthias Galloy and Ruth Hicks,
each one shilling.--To my daughter Polly Stansbury Colston,
&#156;20.-- John Ensor Stansbury executor.--Witness: Benj.
Stansbury, John Talbot Risteau, William Stansbury. John Ensor
Stansbury, who is appointed executor, was the son of William4
(Daniel,3 Tobias,2 Detmar1) and the great nephew of the testator.
Tabitha Cross was doubtless Samuel's daughter, but the Colstons,
whom he calls his son and daughters, seem rather to have been his
grandchildren. As for the other legatees, it is difficult to
trace their connection with the testator, and it is probably
safer to attempt no further interpretation of the will without
additional information. <br>
<br>
8. WILLIAM STANSBURY4 (Daniel,3 Tobias,2 Detmar1) was born 20
January 1716, and died 3 November 1788 in his 73rd year
(Epitaph). His father dying intestate, William, as son and heir,
made provision for two of his brothers. 25 April 1763, William
Stansbury of Baltimore County, planter, son and heir-at-law of
Daniel Stansbury, late of said county deceased, and Elizabeth,
wife of said William, convey to Richard Stansbury, son of said
Daniel deceased, tract Poplar Neck, 100 acres, on Bear Creek, in
Baltimore County (Balto. Co., Lib. B. U. no. L, fol. 350). Also
25 April 1763, the same parties convey to Daniel Stansbury,
another son of said Daniel deceased, tract Prospect, 80 acres, on
Back River, in Baltimore County (ibid. fol. 353). William
Stansbury married, 14 Feb'y 1739/40, Elizabeth daughter of John
Ensor. She was born 12 July 1721, and died 10 Sept. 1799
(Epitaph). Her father in his will, dated 10 April 1771, and
proved 11 March 1773 (Balto., Lib. 3, fol. 240), leaves a bequest
to his &quot;grandson John Ensor Stansbury, son of my daughter
Elizabeth Stansbury.&quot; William Stansbury4 and Elizabeth
(Ensor) his wife had issue:-- <br>
i. WILLIAM STANSBURY,5 b. 4 April 1746; d. 1826; m. Belinda --
(b. 1750; d. 7 April 1830). <br>
20. ii. ABRAHAM STANSBURY, b --; d. 1811. <br>
iii. ISAAC STANSBURY, b. 2 July 1752; d. Oct. 1792. <br>
iv. JACOB STANSBURY, b. 14 March 1755; d. 22 Feb'y 1812. <br>
v. ELIJAH STANSBURY, m. 10, 27 Dec. 1779, Sarah Gorsuch, 20, 15
Nov. 1783, Elizabeth Gorsuch. <br>
vi. JOHN ENSOR STANSBURY, b. 1760; d. 30 April 1841; m. 10, Mary
-- (b. 1777; d. 1800), 20, Ann -- (b. 1783; d. 1 April 1815). <br>
vii. RUTH STANSBURY, b. 28 April 1744. <br>
viii. ELIZABETH STANSBURY, m. James Edwards. <br>
9. RICHARDSON STANSBURY4 (Daniel,3 Tobias,2 Detmar1) is doubtless
correctly placed here, but a word of explanation is necessary.
The register of St. Paul's Parish records that Richard Stansbury,
son of Daniel and Elizabeth, was born 20 May 1723. A later hand
has converted &quot;Richard&quot; into &quot;Richardson.&quot;
That the clerk who made the original entry accidentally dropped
the final syllable &quot;son,&quot; is probable enough, as it is
an error specially easy to make; and the person who made the
correction seems to have been well informed. Richardson Stansbury
lived in Back River Neck with the other sons of Daniel. He was
undoubtedly a grandson of Tobias, and a careful examination fails
to to find a place for him elsewhere than among the sons of
Daniel. In a deposition, made in 1773, he gives his age as 50
years (Balto. Co., A. L. No. R, 272) which agrees precisely with
the record of birth in St. Paul's register. Richardson Stansbury
married, 23 February 1747, Mary daughter of Isaac Raven (d. 1757)
of Baltimore County, and Letitia his wife daughter of Joseph Ward
(d. 1754) of Back River Neck. The will of &quot;Richardson
Stansbury of Back River Neck, in Baltimore County&quot; is dated
30 January 1797, and was proved 22 April following (Balto., Lib.
5, fol. 507). In it he names the children given below, makes his
grandson William Boswell one of his residuary legatees, and
appoints his son Isaac his executor. Richardson Stansbury4 and
Mary (Raven) his wife had issue:-- <br>
i. JOSEPH WARD STANSBURY,5 b. 24 Jan'y 1749; living 1797. <br>
ii. ISAAC STANSBURY, executor of his father's will, 1797. <br>
21. iii. RICHARDSON STANSBURY, of Middle River Neck, d. 1819. <br>

vi. DEBORAH STANSBURY. <br>
vii. CASSANDRA STANSBURY, b. 13 April 1761; m. -- Bonfield. <br>
10. RICHARD STANSBURY4 (Daniel,3 Tobias,2 Detmar1) was born 22
May 1725, and died in 1791. He had a deed of gift, 25 April 1763,
from his brother William of a tract of 100 acres in Baltimore
County called Poplar Neck, and this tract was, at Richard's
death, divided among his four sons by deed of partition recorded
in Baltimore County. His will, dated 28 May 1791 and proved 6
October following (Balto. Lib. 5, fol. 11), names his wife Sarah
and the four sons and three daughters given below. The Maryland
Journal of 2 July 1782 has this obituary: &quot;Died. In the
prime of life, Mr. Solomon Stansbury and his two sisters, viz:
Sarah and Elizabeth, son and daughters of Richard Stansbury of
Patapsco Neck, a few days ago were drowned by the oversetting of
a canoe in the River&quot; &amp;c. &amp;c. In addition to these
three, Richard Stansbury and Sarah his wife had issue:-- <br>
i. DANIEL STANSBURY.5 <br>
ii. THOMAS STANSBURY, b. 2 Sept. 1770. <br>
22. iii. JOSIAS STANSBURY, d. 26 April 1825. <br>
iv. JOSHUA STANSBURY. <br>
v. KEZIAH STANSBURY. <br>
vi. TABITHA STANSBURY. <br>
vii. PRISCILLA STANSBURY. <br>
11. DANIEL STANSBURY4 (Daniel,3 Tobias,2 Detmar1) of Patapsco
Neck, Baltimore County, was born 23 July 1727, and died in
October or November 1803. His father, Daniel, having died
intestate, and therefore without making provision for his younger
sons, his eldest brother, William, conveyed to him by deed of
gift, dated 25 April 1763, a tract of 80 acres called Prospect,
on Back River (Balto. Co., Lib. B. no. L, fol. 353), and 20 April
1768, Aquilla Gostwick and Elizabeth his wife conveyed to
&quot;Daniel Stansbury son of Daniel&quot; a tract of 100 acres
called Adventure (ib. Lib. A. L. no. A, fol. 39). In his will,
dated 26 October, and proved 26 November, 1803 (Balto. Lib. 7,
fol. 256), he leaves to his eldest son Daniel the tract
&quot;Adventure which I purchased of Aquilla Gorsuch&quot;
(sic!); to his son William, the tract Force &quot;which I now
live on&quot;; and leaves legacies to his daughters Rebecca Bowen
and Elizabeth Phipps, and to his granddaughter Averilla Bowen.
The witnesses are Josias Stansbury, Joshua Stansbury, and Thomas
Jones, the first two being his nephews, sons of his brother
Richard. Testator's wife is not mentioned and was presumably
dead. Daniel Stansbury4 had issue: <br>
i. DANIEL STANSBURY.5 <br>
ii. WILLIAM STANSBURY.5 <br>
iii. REBECCA STANSBURY, m. -- Bowen. <br>
iv. ELIZABETH STANSBURY, m. -- Phipps. <br>
12. JOHN STANSBURY4 (Thomas,3 Tobias,2 Detmar1) is named in his
father's will as his eldest son. In a deposition made in 1785 he
gives his age as 75 years and mentions his father Thomas
Stansbury (Balto. Co., W. G. no. Y, 190). He was born, therefore,
about 1710, and he probably died not many years after 1785. He
married, 12 Feb'y 1734, Ann Ensor, and had issue (with perhaps
others):-- <br>
i. JANE STANSBURY,5 b. 26 June 1736. <br>
ii. JOHN STANSBURY, b. 23 Jan'y 1737/8. <br>
iii. ELIZABETH STANSBURY, b. 25 Feb'y 1739. <br>

April 1714, and died in 1798. In his will, proved 30 June 1798
and recorded in Baltimore, he names the children given below. He
married, 2 March 1735, Hannah daughter of Charles Gorsuch and
Sarah Coale his wife. They had issue (order of birth uncertain): <br>
i. CHARLES STANSBURY, b. 24 Jan'y 1736. <br>
ii. LUKE STANSBURY, dead in 1798, leaving a widow Catherine. <br>

July 1774, William Wilson (b. 1749; d. 30 March 1824). <br>
x. RACHEL STANSBURY, m. -- Lemon. <br>
14. DANIEL STANSBURY4 (Thomas,3 Tobias,2 Detmar1) of Anne Arundel
County was probably born about 1716-18, though this is largely
conjectural, and died in December 1769. His will, dated 22
December 1769, was proved 29 January 1770 (Annapolis, Lib. 37,
fol. 487) and mentions testator's wife Elizabeth and his children
as given below. He married, about 1740, Elizabeth (b. 24 Dec.
1718) daughter of John Ashman (d. 1737) of Anne Arundel County
and Constant his wife daughter of John Wilmot (d. 1719) of
Baltimore County. Daniel Stansbury4 and Elizabeth (Ashman) his
wife had issue (dates from St. Margaret's, A. A. Co.): <br>
23. i. EZEKIEL STANSBURY,5 b. 13, March 1740/1; d. December 1789.
<br>

25. iii. JOSEPH STANSBURY, b. 19 Feb'y 1745/6; d. Dec. 1798. <br>
iv. CHARITY STANSBURY, b. 31 January 1747/8; d. 1777; m. George
Presstman of Balto. Co. <br>

15. DIXON STANSBURY4 (Thomas,3 Tobias,2 Detmar1) was born 6 Dec.
1720, and died in 1805. He married, 4 January 1740/1, Penelope
(b. 27 Nov. 1724) daughter of Stephen and Elizabeth Body (St.
Paul's, Balto. Co.). His will, dated 19 March 1805, was proved 4
December following (Balto., Lib. 8, fol. 10). His wife is not
mentioned in it, and she was doubtless dead at the time. Dixon
Stansbury4 and Penelope (Body) his wife had issue: <br>
i. DIXON STANSBURY,5 b. 22 July 1744; living 1805. <br>
26. ii. CAPT. EDMUND STANSBURY, b. 6 Oct. 1746; d. 1801. <br>

16. EDMUND STANSBURY4 (Thomas,3 Tobias,2 Detmar1) was born 13
January 1724/5, and died 22 April 1780. He died intestate, and
letters of administration were issued, 12 January 1781, to Joseph
Cromwell, with Wm. Cromwell and Thomas Miles as sureties (Balto.
Administrations, Lib. 1, fol. 181). Edmund Stansbury married,
about 1775, Keziah Gostwick (b. 1753, d. 7 July 1809) who
survived him and married, secondly, Joseph Cromwell (b. about
1743, d. 12 Nov. 1800). Edmund Stansbury4 and Keziah Gostwick his
wife had issue: <br>
i. JANE STANSBURY,5 b. 3 Oct. 1776. <br>
ii. MARY STANSBURY, b. 30 Oct. 1778. <br>
iii. KEZIAH STANSBURY, b. 22 Feb'y 1780. <br>
17. CAPT. TOBIAS STANSBURY4 (Luke,3 Tobias,2 Detmar1) was born 23
March 1718/9, and died in October 1757. The Annapolis Maryland
Gazette of 20 October 1757 has the following brief obituary:
&quot;A few days ago died, in Baltimore County, Capt. Tobias
Stansbury.&quot; He doubtless held a commission as Captain in the
County militia. His will dated 6 October 1757, was proved 31
March 1758 (Balto., Lib. 2, fol. 68). Tobias Stansbury married,
27 April 1746, Mary Hammond, daughter of Thomas Hammond of Queen
Anne County and Catherine Emerson his wife. Thomas Hammond, born
19 Dec. 1693, was the son of William, and the grandson of Maj.
Gen. John Hammond. The record of Tobias Stansbury's marriage and
of the births of his children may be found in the register of St.
Paul's, Baltimore, with exception of Gen. Tobias Emerson
Stansbury, whose birth is not entered. There is, however, ample
proof that Gen Stansbury was the unborn child mentioned in his
father's will. Capt. Tobias Stansbury4 and Mary (Hammond) his
wife had issue: <br>
i. HENRIETTA STANSBURY,5 b. 26 Feb'y 1747/8. <br>
ii. CATHERINE STANSBURY, b. 28 March 1749. <br>

20. ABRAHAM STANSBURY5 (William,4 Daniel,3 Tobias2) died in 1811.
His will, dated 19 August 1811, was proved 2 October following
(Balto., Lib. 9, fol. 174). His wife was named Elizabeth, as
appears from the register of St. James' Parish, Baltimore County,
where the births of four of their children are recorded, but her
surname is unknown. She may, however, have been an Edwards, as
may be conjectured from the fact that no less than three of their
nine children bear this name. Abraham Stansbury5 and Elizabeth
his wife had issue:-- <br>
i. WILLIAM STANSBURY.6 <br>
ii. ISAAC STANSBURY. <br>
iii. CHARITY STANSBURY, m. George C. Collins. <br>

Middle River Neck, Baltimore County, died in 1819. His will,
dated 17 July 1815, was proved 20 October 1819 Balto., Lib. 11,
fol. 71). He married, 14 April 1791, Sarah daughter of Luke Raven
(d. 1798) and Anne Rigbie his wife. They had issue:-- <br>

and married secondly, 28 August 1796, Thomas Greenwood. Ezekiel
Stansbury died intestate, and his widow Keziah filed her bond for
the administration of his estate 5 January 1790 (Balto. Admin.
Bonds, Lib. 7, fol. 242), her sureties being Emanuel Stansbury
and John Eager Howard. From the date of the bond, it would appear
that Ezekiel had died in the course of the preceding month,
December. Ezekiel Stansbury5 and Keziah his wife had issue:-- <br>
i. ELIZABETH ANN STANSBURY,6 b. 15 March 1772; d. 1862; m., 23

express his indebtedness to Mrs. Walter Damon Mansfield of San

placing at his disposal her extensive Stansbury collections,
which have been freely utilized. It is to be hoped that other
Stansbury descendants will add to the completeness of the
genealogy by sending to the editor such additions, especially in
the earlier portion, as they may be able to make.
